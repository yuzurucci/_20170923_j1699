***********************************************************************************************************
The J1699-3 software performs some tests in a different order than the SAE J1699-3 document specifies. 
In these cases, the SAE J1699-3 Task Force has determined that this variation in order of these 
specific tests will not impact the test results. At the present time, there is no intent to change 
the software, but the issue is noted in SourceForge (#1485866). 

The sections where there is a variation in the testing order are: 5.5.x, 5.6.x, 5.7.2, 5.10.x, 5.11.2, 
5.12.x, 5.14.x, 5.16.2, 5.17.x, 5.18.2, 6.5.x, 7.5.x, 8.5.x, 9.5.x, 10.12.x.

    M$01 P$01 Evaluate Data B, BIT 5
    M$01 P$01 Evaluate Data B, BIT 6
